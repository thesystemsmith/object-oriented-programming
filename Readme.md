OOP is a paradigm that uses “objects” — entities that combine data and behavior

The four fundamental principles of OOP — encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism

Encapsulation ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside view. Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another. Lastly, Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

Encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling the data (variables) and the code (methods) that manipulates the data into a single unit, called a class. 

Abstraction is about focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it. 

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods of an existing class

Polymorphism means “many forms.” In OOP, it allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon, even though they share the same name. This is achieved in Java through method overloading (same method name with different parameters within the same class) and method overriding (same method name with the same parameters in subclass and superclass).

In polymorphism, when a method is called, Java determines which version of the method to execute at runtime, not at compile time. This is known as dynamic binding, which allows Java programs to be flexible and adaptable to changing conditions during execution.

Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge one class has about another. Lower coupling is desirable because it makes a system more modular and adaptable. Cohesion refers to how closely the operations in a class are related to each other. High cohesion is desirable because it means that a class is designed to do a specific job well.

An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. The object has its own state, behavior, and identity. It’s the implementation of the class blueprint.

method overloading - compile time polymorphism
method overriding - run time polymorphism
